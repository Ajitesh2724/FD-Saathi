##  What is FD Saathi?

FD Saathi is an **AI-powered Fixed Deposit advisor** built for first-time and semi-urban investors across India — especially those who speak Hindi, Bhojpuri, or Awadhi and feel left out of formal financial tools.

Most FD apps talk in banking jargon. FD Saathi talks like a **knowledgeable friend from the neighbourhood** — in your language, at your level.

Built for a hackathon, designed for real-world use.

## ✨ Features

###  Multilingual AI Chat
Powered by Google Gemini 1.5 Flash. The AI detects whether you write in **Hindi, Bhojpuri, Awadhi, or English** and responds naturally in that exact dialect — no switching needed.

###  Voice Input
Speak your question in Hindi or English — the mic button transcribes your voice directly into the chat input using the browser's Speech Recognition API.

###  Smart FD Calculator
Interactive sidebar calculator with a **bank selector** — choose any bank from the full list and see live maturity calculations with senior citizen bonus support.

###  FD Laddering Planner
A first-of-its-kind feature for Indian retail investors. Split your total investment across 2-5 FDs with staggered maturities so you always have liquidity. Auto-suggests the top-N banks by rate, with a full bank picker so you can override any suggestion.

###  TDS Calculator
Know exactly how much tax will be deducted on your FD interest. Includes Form 15G/15H guidance, PAN card advice, and slab-based breakdowns — fully multilingual.

###  FD Portfolio Tracker
Add, track, and delete your real FDs. See a visual progress bar for each FD, days remaining to maturity, interest earned, and a mini bar chart comparing all your FDs.

###  Branch Finder
Find the nearest branch of any bank using live OpenStreetMap data. Includes helpline numbers, email, official branch locator links, and a full required-documents checklist for opening an FD.

###  Demo Mode
One-click demo that walks through a complete FD conversation so you can understand the product instantly without typing.

###  Live Rate Ticker
A scrolling ticker at the top shows real-time FD rates across all banks in the app.


###  DICGC Safety
Every recommendation reminds users that their deposits are insured up to ₹5 lakh under DICGC — a key trust signal for first-time investors.

##  Local Setup

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed:

| Tool | Version | Download |
|------|---------|----------|
| Node.js | 18+ | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| Python | 3.11+ | [python.org](https://python.org) |
| Git | Any | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) |

---

### Step 1 — Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fd-saathi.git
cd fd-saathi
```

---

### Step 2 — Get your Gemini API key

1. Go to [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **"Create API Key"**
4. Copy the key — it starts with `AIza...`

> The free tier gives you **1,500 requests/day** on Gemini 1.5 Flash — more than enough for development and demo use.

---

### Step 3 — Set up the backend

```bash
cd backend

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now create your `.env` file inside the `backend/` folder:

```bash
# Create .env file
echo GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaYOUR_KEY_HERE > .env
```

Or create it manually — make a file called `.env` inside `backend/` with this content:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaYOUR_KEY_HERE
```

Start the backend:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

You should see:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
[gemini_service] ✅ GEMINI_API_KEY loaded (ends with ...XXXXXX)
```

Test it by visiting [http://localhost:8000/health](http://localhost:8000/health) in your browser. You should see `{"status":"healthy"}`.

---

### Step 4 — Set up the frontend

Open a **new terminal** (keep the backend running):

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside `frontend/`:

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Start the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
  VITE v6.x.x  ready in XXX ms
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) — FD Saathi should be running!

##  Important Notes

**DICGC Insurance:** All banks listed in this app are DICGC-insured up to ₹5 lakh. This is real and verified. Users are always reminded of this.

**FD Rates:** Interest rates are hardcoded in `fd_data.py` and `ChatWindow.jsx`. They were accurate at the time of development. Update them periodically to keep the app current.

**Mock Booking:** The `/api/fd/book` endpoint is a mock — it generates a realistic booking confirmation but does not actually open an FD at any bank. This is a demo feature.

**Data Privacy:** No user data is sent to any server except the chat messages sent to the Gemini API. Portfolio and chat history are stored only in the user's browser via localStorage.
